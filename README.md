I have created logistict regression model to predict 'verified' or 'not verified' account of TikTok. 
This project is a part of Google Advanced Data Analytics professional Certificate Program. 
This course helped me a lot to apply the statistical theory in real life problem. 
Here I cleaned the data. Detected the outliers. And check the correaltions among the variables. 
And remove the highly correlated varibles for avoiding multicolinearity.
Then also applied the one hot encoding.
